## npm-check-updates

npm-check-updates upgrades your package.json dependencies to the latest
versions, ignoring specified versions.

npm-check-updates maintains your existing semantic versioning policies, i.e.,
it will upgrade `"express": "^4.0.0"` to `"express": "^5.0.0"`.

## mversion

A cross packaging manager module version handler/bumper. Imitates _npm version_
to also work on other packaging files. For those times you have either have
multiple packaging files (like `bower.json`, `component.json`, `manifest.json`)
or just not a `package.json` file. mversion can easily bump your version and
optionally commit and create a tag.
