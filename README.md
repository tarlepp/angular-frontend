## Requirements [ᐞ](#table-of-contents)

* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Recommendations [ᐞ](#table-of-contents)

* `*nix platform` - most likely you're going to host your application on *nix
  platform - so I would recommend to do development also on that platform.
* `Makefile` support - if you don't have this you need to look `Makefile` file
  to see what each `make` command is doing.

## Installation [ᐞ](#table-of-contents)

### 1. Clone repository [ᐞ](#table-of-contents)

Use your favorite IDE and get checkout from GitHub or just use following command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tarlepp/angular-frontend.git
```

### 2. Start containers [ᐞ](#table-of-contents)

For this just run following command:

```bash
make start
```

This command will create one (1) Docker container where your application is
running on development stage.

### 3. Using application [ᐞ](#table-of-contents)

By default `make start` command starts Angular application on Docker container
and exposes following port on `localhost`:

* 4200 (Angular Live Development Server)

And this application is usable within your browser on `http://localhost:4200`
address.

Note that this frontend application assumes that your backend is running on
`http://localhost:8000` address. Also note that _"default"_
[backend](https://github.com/tarlepp/symfony-flex-backend)
is running on that address by default.

### 4. Getting shell to container [ᐞ](#table-of-contents)

After you've run `make start` command you can list all running containers with
`docker ps` command.

And to eg. get shell access inside one of those containers you can run following
shortcut command:

```bash
make bash
```

Where that `node` is that actual container where this backend application is
running.

### 5. Building containers [ᐞ](#table-of-contents)

For time to time you probably need to build containers again. This is something
that you should do always if you have some problems to get containers up and
running. This you can do with following command:

```bash
make start-build
```
